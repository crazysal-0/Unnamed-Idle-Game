# Unnamed-Idle-Game
A game I made with html, css and js. There are secrets in the dev console, this game is very new by the way; so it's kinda basic. I will add updates later on, if you want me to add anything just ask!

## How to Play:

### How to Install:

Hit the three dots and then hit "Download Zip". in your file explorer, unzip the file. Find the version you want to run and find that versions index.html, right click on the .html file and click run with your broswer.

### How to Play

To play this game you need to click until you can buy an upgrade, for really early game I'd reccomend buying click power upgrades because they are cheap and work well. So when your done that you can get auto clickers, which automaticaly give you clicks. So yeah once you have those your good to afk!
