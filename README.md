# Unnamed-Idle-Game
A game I made with html, css and js. There are secrets in the dev console, this game is very new by the way; so it's kinda basic. I will add updates later on, if you want me to add anything just ask!

## How to Play:

Hit the three dots and then hit "Download Zip". in your file explorer, unzip the file. Find the version you want to run and find that versions index.html, right click on the .html file and click run with your broswer.
